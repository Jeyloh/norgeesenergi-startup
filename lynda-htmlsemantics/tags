html5 contains so many new semantic tags such as the following:
<header>
<nav>
<article>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>
<main>
<figure>

There are more, but these are the most common. The use of <div> is therefore
becoming obsolete and has no specific usage. The main area you'll find
<div> would be in tabs and accordions, or to float two parts to right and left.
There are however most of the time better tags than <div>.

If the <aside> is  placed inside a section it means that it's related to that
section and should contain supporting information to that section. Some short
facts around an article etc.

<article> specifies independent and self contained content and should make
sense if it's taken out of it's surrounding content. Imagine being able to send
a whole article through an RSS feed and still making sense.
Examples: Forum posts, blog posts, news story and comments

<section> defines the documents sections such as chapters, headers, footers etc.

<aside> depends on where it's placed in the structure. If it's not related to
any parent sections then it defines content <aside> from the main content.
An example is ads or other short info content related to the website.


<dl> means Definition List and consists of two elements:
  <dt> Definition Terms
    The title of the list item and the name of the list

  <dd> Definition
    This tag is the information in the list, just as we use <li> in <ul>

  This is the better way to relate elements together in lists.
